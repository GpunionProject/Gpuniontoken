What is Gpunion?
----------------

GPUnion is a decentralized cloud computing platform. Built on blockchain, GPUnion aims to save the large amounts of computing resources that used to be wasted on mining. and to offer satisfying peer-to-peer computing power trading experiences. Instead of mining random hash values, resources in GPUnion ecosystem empowers modern technologies, including artificial intelligence, scientific computing, deep learning, etc. GUT(GPUnion Token) is used as the digital currency among GPUnion ecosystem to settle payments between providers and customers.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/GpunionProject/Gpuniontoken/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Gpunion Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #gpunion-core-dev.

How GPUnion's tokens are distributed?
-------

Aiming at attracting more GPU miners to get fairly engagement in GPUnion ecosystem, GPUnion tokens are mined in our x16r based anti-ASIC chain called GPUnion Token Distribution Chain before being reflected to the mainnet. Token in GPUnion Token Distribution Chain will be swapped to the same amount of GUT in the main net. We are NOT and will NOT distribute GUTs via any sort of Initial Coin Offering.

### Token Allocation

95% of GUT is available to mine.
5% of GUT is kept as operating expense, among which 96% is reserved and locked for the future use, 4% for the system development.


### Provider Experiences

Providers can switch between mining mode and provider mode in GPUnion's system. The minimum mining profit and 5X extra GUTs are rewarded during provider mode.

### Customer Experiences

With P2P network infrastructure, GPUnion provides once-click SSH into the chosen provider's docker container with solid credential.

Our Mission
----------------
Our mission is to change the world from establishing a sharing computing power platform. With our cutting edge technology and brightest professionals, we are dedicated to help both businesses and individuals scale and grow through redistributing computing resources to more valuable projects, including machine learning, rendering, scientific calculating and other tasks that rely on GPUs.

FAQ
----------------
Why GUTs are not distributed via ICO?
ICO is not an ideal way to attract real GPU miners. The x16r hash algorithm based blockchain ensures GUT to distribute evenly across the entire mining community. Special thanks to @RavenProject.
